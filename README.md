# Lunar Lander v3 (Gymnasium) Project
This repository showcases an advanced deep learning project focused on developing an autonomous lunar lander using the Gymnasium environment.
Leveraging the power of PyTorch, we've trained a sophisticated Deep Q-Learning model capable of executing precise landings between flag poles in a challenging virtual lunar landscape.

## Environment
Our project utilizes the Lunar Lander v3 environment, a complex simulation provided by Gymnasium. Experience the challenge firsthand: [https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/box2d/lunar_lander/](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/box2d/lunar_lander/)

## Project Overview
The core of the project is to learn on how to build and train a deep Q learning model using PyTorch. 
PyTorch Framework: Harnesses the flexibility and power of PyTorch for neural network design and training.
Autonomous Decision Making: The agent learns to make real-time decisions for smooth landings in varying conditions.
Performance Optimization: Rigorous hyperparameter tuning for maximizing learning efficiency and landing accuracy.

The Jupyter Notebook included in this repository provides a detailed walkthrough of the model architecture, training process, and evaluation metrics which consists of using of Reinforcement Learning, Deep Q Learning.

## Getting Started

Replicate our results easily:

    Clone this repository

    Open the provided Jupyter Notebook

    Run the notebook in Google Colab or your local environment (ensure PyTorch and Gymnasium are installed)
